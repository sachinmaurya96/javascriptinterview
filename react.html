                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library which is useful in developing user
                            interfaces specifically for applications with a single page. It is helpful in building
                            complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of mobile and web applications as it
                            follows the component-based approach.</p>
                        <p>The important features of React are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It supports server-side rendering.</li>
                            <li>It will make use of the virtual DOM rather than real DOM (Data Object Model) as RealDOM
                                manipulations are expensive.</li>
                            <li>It follows unidirectional data binding or data flow.</li>
                            <li>It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>2. What are the advantages of using React?</h3>
                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>MVC is generally abbreviated as Model View Controller.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Use of Virtual DOM to improve efficiency: </strong>React uses virtual DOM to
                                render the view. As the name suggests, virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the
                                real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created.
                                Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser.
                                Therefore, with the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of the app improves.

                                <strong>Gentle learning curve:</strong> React has a gentle learning curve when compared
                                to frameworks like Angular. Anyone with little knowledge of javascript can start
                                building web applications using React.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>SEO friendly:</strong> React allows developers to develop engaging user
                                interfaces that can be easily navigated in various search engines. It also allows
                                server-side rendering, which boosts the SEO of an app.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Reusable components: </strong>React uses component-based architecture for
                                developing applications. Components are independent and reusable bits of code. These
                                components can be shared across various applications having similar functionality. The
                                re-use of components increases the pace of development.

                                <strong>Huge ecosystem of libraries to choose from: </strong>React provides you with the
                                freedom to choose the tools, libraries, and architecture for developing an application
                                based on your requirement.

                    <h3>4. What is useState() in React?</h3>
                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>The useState() is a built-in React Hook that allows you for having state variables in
                            functional components. It should be used when the DOM has something that is dynamically
                            manipulating/controlling.</p>
                        <p>In the below-given example code, The useState(0) will return a tuple where the count is the
                            first parameter that represents the counter’s current state and the second parameter
                            setCounter method will allow us to update the state of the counter.</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">...
            const [count, setCounter] = useState(0);
            const [otherStuffs, setOtherStuffs] = useState(...);
            ...
            const setCount = () =&gt; {
               setCounter(count + 1);
               setOtherStuffs(...);
               ...
            };</code></pre>
                        <p>We can make use of setCounter() method for updating the state of count anywhere. In this
                            example, we are using setCounter() inside the setCount function where various other things
                            can also be done. The idea with the usage of hooks is that we will be able to keep our code
                            more functional and avoid class-based components if they are not required.</p>

                            <li>Keys help react identify which elements were added, changed or removed.</li>
                            <li>Keys should be given to array elements for providing a unique identity for each element.
                            </li>
                            <li>Without keys, React does not understand the order or uniqueness of each element.</li>
                            <li>With keys, React has an idea of which particular element was deleted, edited, and added.
                            </li>
                            <li>Keys are generally used for displaying a list of data coming from an API.</li>

                    <h3>6. What is JSX?</h3>
                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript and place them in
                            the DOM without using functions like appendChild( ) or createElement( ).</p>
                        <p>As stated in the official docs of React, JSX provides syntactic sugar for
                            React.createElement( ) function.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Note- We can create react applications without using JSX as well.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Let’s understand <strong>how JSX works</strong>:</p>
                        <p>Without using JSX, we would have to create an element by the following process:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">const text = React.createElement('p', {}, 'This is a text');
            const container = React.createElement('div','{}',text );
            ReactDOM.render(container,rootElement);</code></pre>
                        <p><strong>Using JSX</strong>, the above code can be simplified:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">const container = (
            &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This is a text&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            );
            ReactDOM.render(container,rootElement);</code></pre>
                        <p>As one can see in the code above, we are directly using HTML inside JavaScript.</p>

                    <h3>7. What are the differences between functional and class components?</h3>
                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>Before the introduction of Hooks in React, functional components were called stateless
                            components and were behind class components on a feature basis. After the introduction of
                            Hooks, functional components are equivalent to class components.</p>
                        <p>Although functional components are the new trend, the react team insists on keeping class
                            components in React. Therefore, it is important to know how these components differ.</p>
                        <p>On the following basis let’s compare functional and class components:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Declaration</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Functional components are nothing but JavaScript functions and therefore can be declared
                            using an arrow function or the function keyword:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">  function card(props){
               return(
                  &lt;div className="main-container"&gt;
                    &lt;h2&gt;Title of the card&lt;/h2&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
                )
               }
               const card = (props) =&gt;{
                return(
                  &lt;div className="main-container"&gt;
                    &lt;h2&gt;Title of the card&lt;/h2&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
                )
               }</code></pre>
                        <p>Class components, on the other hand, are declared using the ES6 class:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs"> class Card extends React.Component{
              constructor(props){
                 super(props);
               }
                render(){
                  return(
                    &lt;div className="main-container"&gt;
                      &lt;h2&gt;Title of the card&lt;/h2&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                  )
                }
               }</code></pre>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Handling props</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Let’s render the following component with props and analyse how functional and class
                            components handle props:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">&lt;Student Info name="Vivek" rollNumber="23" /&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p>In functional components, the handling of props is pretty straightforward. Any prop provided
                            as an argument to a functional component can be directly used inside HTML elements:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs"> function StudentInfo(props){
               return(
                 &lt;div className="main"&gt;
                   &lt;h2&gt;{props.name}&lt;/h2&gt;

                        <p>In the case of class components, props are handled in a different way:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs"> class StudentInfo extends React.Component{
               constructor(props){
                 super(props);
                }
                render(){
                  return(
                    &lt;div className="main"&gt;
                      &lt;h2&gt;{this.props.name}&lt;/h2&gt;
                      &lt;h4&gt;{this.props.rollNumber}&lt;/h4&gt;&nbsp;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                  )
                }
               }</code></pre>
                        <p>As we can see in the code above, <strong>this </strong>keyword is used in the case of class
                            components.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Handling state</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Functional components use React hooks to handle state. It uses the useState hook to set the
                            state of a variable inside the component:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs"> function ClassRoom(props){
               let [studentsCount,setStudentsCount] = useState(0);
                const addStudent = () =&gt; {
                  setStudentsCount(++studentsCount);
               }
                return(
                  &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Number of students in class room: {studentsCount}&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;button onClick={addStudent}&gt;Add Student&lt;/button&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
                )
               }</code></pre>
                        <p>Since useState hook returns an array of two items, the first item contains the current state,
                            and the second item is a function used to update the state.</p>
                        <p>In the code above, using array destructuring we have set the variable name to studentsCount
                            with a current value of “0” and setStudentsCount is the function that is used to update the
                            state.</p>
                        <p>For reading the state, we can see from the code above, the variable name can be directly used
                            to read the current state of the variable.</p>
                        <p>We cannot use React Hooks inside class components, therefore state handling is done very
                            differently in a class component:</p>
                        <p>Let’s take the same above example and convert it into a class component:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">class ClassRoom extends React.Component{
                    constructor(props){
                        super(props);
                        this.state = {studentsCount : 0};
                        
                        this.addStudent = this.addStudent.bind(this);
                     }
                        
                        addStudent(){
                        this.setState((prevState)=&gt;{
                           return {studentsCount: prevState.studentsCount++}
                        });
                     }
                        
                        render(){
                         return(
                           &lt;div&gt;
                             &lt;p&gt;Number of students in class room: {this.state.studentsCount}&lt;/p&gt;
                             &lt;button onClick={this.addStudent}&gt;Add Student&lt;/button&gt;
                           &lt;/div&gt;
                         )
                       }
                     }  </code></pre>
                        <p>In the code above, we see we are using <strong>this.state</strong> to add the variable
                            studentsCount and setting the value to “0”.</p>
                        <p>For reading the state, we are using <strong>this.state.studentsCount</strong>.</p>
                        <p>For updating the state, we need to first bind the addStudent function to
                            <strong>this</strong>. Only then, we will be able to use the <strong>setState</strong>
                            function which is used to update the state.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>8. What is the virtual DOM? How does react use the virtual DOM to render the UI?</h3>
                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>As stated by the react team, virtual DOM is a concept where a virtual representation of the
                            real DOM is kept inside the memory and is synced with the real DOM by a library such as
                            ReactDOM.</p>
                        <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:75%;"><img
                                data-src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/334/original/virtual_DOM.png?1640091398"
                                class="lazy-elem"></figure>
                        <p><strong>Why was virtual DOM introduced?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>DOM manipulation is an integral part of any web application, but DOM manipulation is quite
                            slow when compared to other operations in JavaScript. The efficiency of the application gets
                            affected when several DOM manipulations are being done. Most JavaScript frameworks update
                            the entire DOM even when a small part of the DOM changes.</p>
                        <p>For example, consider a list that is being rendered inside the DOM. If one of the items in
                            the list changes, the entire list gets rendered again instead of just rendering the item
                            that was changed/updated. This is called inefficient updating.</p>
                        <p>To address the problem of inefficient updating, the react team introduced the concept of
                            virtual DOM.</p>
                        <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
                        <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:75%;"><img
                                data-src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/335/original/virtual_DOM-how_does_it_work.png?1640091427"
                                class="lazy-elem"></figure>
                        <p>For every DOM object, there is a corresponding virtual DOM object(copy), which has the same
                            properties. The main difference between the real DOM object and the virtual DOM object is
                            that any changes in the virtual DOM object will not reflect on the screen directly. Consider
                            a virtual DOM object as a blueprint of the real DOM object. Whenever a JSX element gets
                            rendered, every virtual DOM object gets updated.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>**Note- One may think updating every virtual DOM object might be inefficient, but that’s
                                not the case. Updating the virtual DOM is much faster than updating the real DOM since
                                we are just updating the blueprint of the real DOM.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>React uses two virtual DOMs to render the user interface. One of them is used to store the
                            current state of the objects and the other to store the previous state of the objects.
                            Whenever the virtual DOM gets updated, react compares the two virtual DOMs and gets to know
                            about which virtual DOM objects were updated. After knowing which objects were updated,
                            react renders only those objects inside the real DOM instead of rendering the complete real
                            DOM. This way, with the use of virtual DOM, react solves the problem of inefficient
                            updating.</p>

                                <strong>Controlled component: </strong>In a controlled component, the value of the input
                                element is controlled by React. We store the state of the input element inside the code,
                                and by using event-based callbacks, any changes made to the input element will be
                                reflected in the code as well.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When a user enters data inside the input element of a controlled component, onChange function
                            gets triggered and inside the code, we check whether the value entered is valid or invalid.
                            If the value is valid, we change the state and re-render the input element with the new
                            value.</p>
                        <p>Example of a controlled component:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">function FormValidation(props) {
            let [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");
            let updateInput = e =&gt; {
              setInputValue(e.target.value);
            };
            return (

            );
            }</code></pre>
                        <p>As one can see in the code above, the value of the input element is determined by the state
                            of the<strong> inputValue </strong>variable. Any changes made to the input element is
                            handled by the <strong>updateInput</strong> function.</p>

                                <strong>Uncontrolled component:</strong> In an uncontrolled component, the value of the
                                input element is handled by the DOM itself. Input elements inside uncontrolled
                                components work just like normal HTML input form elements.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The state of the input element is handled by the DOM. Whenever the value of the input element
                            is changed, event-based callbacks are not called. Basically, react does not perform any
                            action when there are changes made to the input element.</p>
                        <p>Whenever use enters data inside the input field, the updated data is shown directly. To
                            access the value of the input element, we can use <strong>ref</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Example of an uncontrolled component:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">function FormValidation(props) {
            let inputValue = React.createRef();
            let handleSubmit = e =&gt; {
              alert(`Input value: ${inputValue.current.value}`);
              e.preventDefault();
            };
            return (
              &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;
                  &lt;input type="text" ref={inputValue} /&gt;
                  &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            );
            }</code></pre>
                        <p>As one can see in the code above, we are <strong>not</strong> using <strong>onChange</strong>
                            function to govern the changes made to the input element. Instead, we are using
                            <strong>ref</strong> to access the value of the input element.&nbsp;</p>

                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>The props in React are the inputs to a component of React. They can be single-valued or
                            objects having a set of values that will be passed to components of React during creation by
                            using a naming convention that almost looks similar to HTML-tag attributes. We can say that
                            props are the data passed from a parent component into a child component.</p>
                        <p>The main purpose of props is to provide different component functionalities such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Passing custom data to the React component.</li>
                            <li>Using through <code>this.props.reactProp</code> inside render() method of the component.
                            </li>
                            <li>Triggering state changes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example, consider we are creating an element with reactProp property as given below:
                            <code>&lt;Element reactProp = "1" /&gt;</code><br>This reactProp name will be considered as
                            a property attached to the native props object of React which already exists on each
                            component created with the help of React library: <code>props.reactProp;</code>.</p>

                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>There are two types of side effects in React component. They are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Effects without Cleanup: </strong>This side effect will be used in useEffect
                                which does not restrict the browser from screen update. It also improves the
                                responsiveness of an application. A few common examples are network requests, Logging,
                                manual DOM mutations, etc.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Effects with Cleanup:</strong> Some of the Hook effects will require the cleanup
                                after updating of DOM is done. For example, if you want to set up an external data
                                source subscription, it requires cleaning up the memory else there might be a problem of
                                memory leak. It is a known fact that React will carry out the cleanup of memory when the
                                unmounting of components happens. But the effects will run for each render() method
                                rather than for any specific method. Thus we can say that, before execution of the
                                effects succeeding time the React will also cleanup effects from the preceding render.

                        <p>Sometimes while developing React applications, there is a need to pass data from a component
                            that is higher in the hierarchy to a component that is deeply nested. To pass data between
                            such components, we pass props from a source component and keep passing the prop to the next
                            component in the hierarchy till we reach the deeply nested component.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>disadvantage</strong> of using prop drilling is that the components that should
                            otherwise be not aware of the data have access to the data.</p>

                        <p>When we are not using the error boundary, instead of seeing an error, we see a blank page.
                            Since any error inside the render method leads to unmounting of the component. To display an

                                componentDidCatch.</strong></p>
                        <p>Let’s create an error boundary to handle errors in the render phase:</p>

                        <p>In the code above, <strong>getDerivedStateFromError</strong> function renders the fallback UI

                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>React Hooks are the built-in functions that permit developers for using the state and
                            lifecycle methods within React components. These are newly added features made available in
                            React 16.8 version. Each lifecycle of a component is having 3 phases which include mount,
                            unmount, and update. Along with that, components have properties and states. Hooks will
                            allow using these methods by developers for improving the reuse of code with higher
                            flexibility navigating the component tree.</p>
                        <p>Using Hook, all features of React can be used without writing class components.
                            <i><strong>For example</strong></i>, before React version 16.8, it required a class
                            component for managing the state of a component. But now using the useState hook, we can
                            keep the state in a functional component.</p>

                    <h3>16. Explain React Hooks.</h3>
                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p><strong>What are Hooks? </strong>Hooks are functions that let us “hook into” React state and
                            lifecycle features from a <strong>functional component.</strong></p>
                        <p>React Hooks<strong> cannot</strong> be used in class components. They let us write components
                            without class.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why were Hooks introduced in React?</strong></p>
                        <p>React hooks were introduced in the 16.8 version of React. Previously, functional components
                            were called stateless components. Only class components were used for state management and
                            lifecycle methods. The need to change a functional component to a class component, whenever
                            state management or lifecycle methods were to be used, led to the development of Hooks.</p>
                        <p><i>Example of a hook: </i><strong>useState hook:</strong></p>
                        <p>In functional components, the useState hook lets us define a state for a component:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">function Person(props) {
            // We are declaring a state variable called name.
            // setName is a function to update/change the value of name
            let [name, setName] = useState('');
            }</code></pre>
                        <p>The state variable “name” can be directly used inside the HTML.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>18. What is the use of useEffect React Hooks?</h3>
                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>The useEffect React Hook is used for performing the side effects in functional components.
                            With the help of useEffect, you will inform React that your component requires something to
                            be done after rendering the component or after a state change. The function you have
                            passed(can be referred to as “effect”) will be remembered by React and call afterwards the
                            performance of DOM updates is over. Using this, we can perform various calculations such as
                            data fetching, setting up document title, manipulating DOM directly, etc, that don’t target
                            the output value. The useEffect hook will run by default after the first render and also
                            after each update of the component. React will guarantee that the DOM will be updated by the
                            time when the effect has run by it.</p>
                        <p>The useEffect React Hook will accept 2 arguments:
                            <code>useEffect(callback,[dependencies]);</code></p>
                        <p>Where the first argument callback represents the function having the logic of side-effect and
                            it will be immediately executed after changes were being pushed to DOM. The second argument
                            dependencies represent an optional array of dependencies. The useEffect() will execute the
                            callback only if there is a change in dependencies in between renderings.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">import { useEffect } from 'react';
            function WelcomeGreetings({ name }) {
             const msg = `Hi, ${name}!`;     // Calculates output
             useEffect(() =&gt; {
               document.title = `Welcome to you ${name}`;    // Side-effect!
             }, [name]);
             return &lt;div&gt;{msg}&lt;/div&gt;;         // Calculates output
            }</code></pre>
                        <p>The above code will update the document title which is considered to be a side-effect as it
                            will not calculate the component output directly. That is why updating of document title has
                            been placed in a callback and provided to useEffect().</p>
                        <p>Consider you don’t want to execute document title update each time on rendering of
                            WelcomeGreetings component and you want it to be executed only when the name prop changes
                            then you need to supply name as a dependency to <code>useEffect(callback, [name])</code>.
                        </p>

                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>A Custom Hook is a function in Javascript whose name begins with ‘use’ and which calls other
                            hooks. It is a part of React v16.8 hook update and permits you for reusing the stateful
                            logic without any need for component hierarchy restructuring.</p>
                        <p>In almost all of the cases, custom hooks are considered to be sufficient for replacing render
                            props and HoCs (Higher-Order components) and reducing the amount of nesting required. Custom
                            Hooks will allow you for avoiding multiple layers of abstraction or wrapper hell that might
                            come along with Render Props and HoCs.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>disadvantage</strong> of Custom Hooks is it cannot be used inside of the classes.

                        <p>To enable StrictMode, <code>&lt;React.StrictMode&gt;</code> tags need to be added inside the

                        <p>There are many ways through which one can optimize the performance of a React app, let’s have
                            a look at some of them:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Using useMemo( )</strong> -<ul>
                                    <li>It is a React hook that is used for caching CPU-Expensive functions.</li>
                                    <li>Sometimes in a React app, a CPU-Expensive function gets called repeatedly due to
                                        re-renders of a component, which can lead to slow rendering.<br>useMemo( ) hook
                                        can be used to cache such functions. By using useMemo( ), the CPU-Expensive
                                        function gets called only when it is needed.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Using React.PureComponent -</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>It is a base component class that checks the state and props of a component to
                                        know whether the component should be updated.</li>
                                    <li>Instead of using the simple React.Component, we can use React.PureComponent to
                                        reduce the re-renders of a component unnecessarily.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Maintaining State Colocation -</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This is a process of moving the state as close to where you need it as possible.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Sometimes in React app, we have a lot of unnecessary states inside the parent
                                        component which makes the code less readable and harder to maintain. Not to
                                        forget, having many states inside a single component leads to unnecessary
                                        re-renders for the component.</li>
                                    <li>It is better to shift states which are less valuable to the parent component, to
                                        a separate component.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Lazy Loading -</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>&nbsp;It is a technique used to reduce the load time of a React app. Lazy
                                        loading helps reduce the risk of web app performances to a minimum.</li>

                        <p>As one can see in the code above, we are rendering the child component inside the parent

                            from the parent to the child component.</p>
                        <p>We can use the data passed by the parent component in the following way:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">function ChildComponent(props) {

            }</code></pre>
                        <p>We use the <strong>props.counterValue</strong> to display the data passed on by the parent
                            component.</p>
                        <p><strong>Child Component to Parent Component (using callbacks)</strong></p>
                        <p>This one is a bit tricky. We follow the steps below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create a callback in the parent component which takes in the data needed as a parameter.
                            </li>
                            <li>Pass this callback as a prop to the child component.</li>
                            <li>Send data from the child component using the callback.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We are considering the same example above but in this case, we are going to pass the updated
                            counterValue from child to parent.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step1 and Step2: </strong>Create a callback in the parent component, pass this
                            callback as a prop.</p>

                        <p>As one can see in the code above, we created a function called callback which takes in the

                        <p>Next, we passed the function callback as a prop to the child component.</p>

                        <p>In the code above, we have used the props.counterValue and set it to a variable called
                            childCounterValue.</p>
                        <p>Next, on button click, we pass the incremented childCounterValue to the
                            <strong>props.callbackFunc</strong>.</p>
                        <p>This way, we can pass data from the child to the parent component.&nbsp;</p>

                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>Simply put, Higher-Order Component(HOC) is a function that takes in a component and returns a
                            new component.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>When do we need a Higher Order Component?</strong></p>
                        <p>While developing React applications, we might develop components that are quite similar to
                            each other with minute differences. In most cases, developing similar components might not
                            be an issue but, while developing larger applications we need to keep our code
                            <strong>DRY</strong>, therefore, we want an <strong>abstraction</strong> that allows us to
                            define this logic in a single place and share it across components. HOC allows us to create
                            that abstraction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example of a HOC:</strong></p>
                        <p>Consider the following components having similar functionality. The following component
                            displays the list of articles:</p>

               this.state = {
                 articles: GlobalDataSource.getArticles(),

             componentDidMount() {

             return class extends React.Component {
               constructor(props) {

                        <p>We know HOC is a function that takes in a component and returns a component.</p>
                        <p>In the code above, we have created a function called HOC which returns a component and
                            performs functionality that can be shared across both the <strong>ArticlesList</strong>
                            component and <strong>UsersList</strong> Component.</p>
                        <p>The second parameter in the HOC function is the function that calls the method on the API
                            endpoint.</p>
                        <p>We have reduced the duplicated code of the <strong>componentDidUpdate</strong> and
                            <strong>componentDidMount</strong> functions.</p>
                        <p>Using the concept of Higher-Order Components, we can now render the
                            <strong>ArticlesList</strong> and <strong>UsersList </strong>components in the following
                            way:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">const ArticlesListWithHOC = HOC(ArticlesList, (GlobalDataSource) =&gt; GlobalDataSource.getArticles());
            const UsersListWithHOC = HOC(UsersList, (GlobalDataSource) =&gt; GlobalDataSource.getUsers());</code></pre>
                        <p>Remember, we are not trying to change the functionality of each component, we are trying to
                            share a single functionality across multiple components using HOC.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>27. What are the different phases of the component lifecycle?</h3>
                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>There are four different phases in the lifecycle of React component. They are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Initialization:</strong> During this phase, React component will prepare by
                                setting up the default props and initial state for the upcoming tough journey.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Mounting: </strong>Mounting refers to putting the elements into the browser DOM.
                                Since React uses VirtualDOM, the entire browser DOM which has been currently rendered
                                would not be refreshed. This phase includes the lifecycle methods
                                <code>componentWillMount</code> and <code>componentDidMount</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Updating:</strong> In this phase, a component will be updated when there is a
                                change in the state or props of a component. This phase will have lifecycle methods like
                                <code>componentWillUpdate</code>, <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>,
                                <code>render</code>, and<code> componentDidUpdate</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Unmounting:</strong> In this last phase of the component lifecycle, the
                                component will be removed from the DOM or will be unmounted from the browser DOM. This
                                phase will have the lifecycle method named <code>componentWillUnmount</code>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>React lifecycle hooks will have the methods that will be automatically called at different
                            phases in the component lifecycle and thus it provides good control over what happens at the
                            invoked point. It provides the power to effectively control and manipulate what goes on
                            throughout the component lifecycle.</p>
                        <p>For example, if you are developing the YouTube application, then the application will make
                            use of a network for buffering the videos and it consumes the power of the battery (assume
                            only these two). After playing the video if the user switches to any other application, then
                            you should make sure that the resources like network and battery are being used most
                            efficiently. You can stop or pause the video buffering which in turn stops the battery and
                            network usage when the user switches to another application after video play.</p>
                        <p>So we can say that the developer will be able to produce a quality application with the help
                            of lifecycle methods and it also helps developers to make sure to plan what and how to do it
                            at different points of birth, growth, or death of user interfaces.</p>
                        <p>The various lifecycle methods are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <code>constructor()</code>: This method will be called when the component is initiated
                                before anything has been done. It helps to set up the initial state and initial values.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>getDerivedStateFromProps()</code>: This method will be called just before
                                element(s) rendering in the DOM. It helps to set up the state object depending on the
                                initial props. The getDerivedStateFromProps() method will have a state as an argument
                                and it returns an object that made changes to the state. This will be the first method
                                to be called on an updating of a component.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>render()</code>: This method will output or re-render the HTML to the DOM with new
                                changes. The render() method is an essential method and will be called always while the
                                remaining methods are optional and will be called only if they are defined.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>componentDidMount()</code>: This method will be called after the rendering of the
                                component. Using this method, you can run statements that need the component to be
                                already kept in the DOM.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code>: The Boolean value will be returned by this method
                                which will specify whether React should proceed further with the rendering or not. The
                                default value for this method will be True.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</code>: This method will provide access for the props as
                                well as for the state before the update. It is possible to check the previously present
                                value before the update, even after the update.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>componentDidUpdate()</code>: This method will be called after the component has
                                been updated in the DOM.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>componentWillUnmount()</code>: This method will be called when the component
                                removal from the DOM is about to happen.
                            </li>

                        <p>Static typing refers to the process of code check during the time of compilation for ensuring
                            all variables will be statically typed. React Hooks are functions that are designed to make
                            sure about all attributes must be statically typed. For enforcing stricter static typing
                            within our code, we can make use of the React API with custom Hooks.</p>

                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>There are two types of Hooks in React. They are:</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Built-in Hooks:</strong> The built-in Hooks are divided into 2 parts as given
                            below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Basic Hooks:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>useState()</code>: This functional component is used to set and retrieve
                                        the state.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>useEffect()</code>: It enables for performing the side effects in the
                                        functional components.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>useContext()</code>: It is used for creating common data that is to be
                                        accessed by the components hierarchy without having to pass the props down to
                                        each level.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Additional Hooks:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>useReducer()</code> : It is used when there is a complex state logic that
                                        is having several sub-values or when the upcoming state is dependent on the
                                        previous state. It will also enable you to optimization of component performance
                                        that will trigger deeper updates as it is permitted to pass the dispatch down
                                        instead of callbacks.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>useMemo()</code> : This will be used for recomputing the memoized value
                                        when there is a change in one of the dependencies. This optimization will help
                                        for avoiding expensive calculations on each render.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>useCallback()</code> : This is useful while passing callbacks into the
                                        optimized child components and depends on the equality of reference for the
                                        prevention of unneeded renders.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>useImperativeHandle()</code>: &nbsp;It will enable modifying the instance
                                        that will be passed with the ref object.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>useDebugValue()</code>: It is used for displaying a label for custom hooks
                                        in React DevTools.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>useRef()</code> : It will permit creating a reference to the DOM element
                                        directly within the functional component.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>useLayoutEffect()</code>: It is used for the reading layout from the DOM
                                        and re-rendering synchronously.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>2. Custom Hooks: </strong>A custom Hook is basically a function of JavaScript. The
                            Custom Hook working is similar to a regular function. The “use” at the beginning of the
                            Custom Hook Name is required for React to understand that this is a custom Hook and also it
                            will describe that this specific function follows the rules of Hooks. Moreover, developing
                            custom Hooks will enable you for extracting component logic from within reusable functions.

                        <p>Our goal is for Hooks to cover all the functionalities for classes at its earliest. There are
                            no Hook equivalents for the following methods that are not introduced in Hooks yet:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</code></li>
                            <li><code>getDerivedStateFromError()</code></li>
                            <li><code>componentDidCatch()</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Since it is an early time for Hooks, few third-party libraries may not be compatible with
                            Hooks at present, but they will be added soon.</p>

                    <h3>34. What is React Router?</h3>
                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>React Router refers to the standard library used for routing in React. It permits us for
                            building a single-page web application in React with navigation without even refreshing the
                            page when the user navigates. It also allows to change the browser URL and will keep the
                            user interface in sync with the URL. React Router will make use of the component structure
                            for calling the components, using which appropriate information can be shown. Since React is
                            a component-based framework, it’s not necessary to include and use this package. Any other
                            compatible routing library would also work with React.</p>
                        <p>The major components of React Router are given below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>BrowserRouter:</strong> It is a router implementation that will make use of the
                                HTML5 history API (pushState, popstate, and event replaceState) for keeping your UI to
                                be in sync with the URL. It is the parent component useful in storing all other
                                components.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Routes: </strong>It is a newer component that has been introduced in the React
                                v6 and an upgrade of the component.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Route: </strong>It is considered to be a conditionally shown component and some
                                UI will be rendered by this whenever there is a match between its path and the current
                                URL.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Link:</strong> It is useful in creating links to various routes and implementing
                                navigation all over the application. It works similarly to the anchor tag in HTML.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>35. Can React Hook replaces Redux?</h3>
                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>The React Hook cannot be considered as a replacement for Redux (It is an open-source,
                            JavaScript library useful in managing the application state) when it comes to the management
                            of the global application state tree in large complex applications, even though the React
                            will provide a useReducer hook that manages state transitions similar to Redux. Redux is
                            very useful at a lower level of component hierarchy to handle the pieces of a state which
                            are dependent on each other, instead of a declaration of multiple useState hooks.</p>
                        <p>In commercial web applications which is larger, the complexity will be high, so using only
                            React Hook may not be sufficient. Few developers will try to tackle the challenge with the
                            help of React Hooks and others will combine React Hooks with the Redux.</p>

                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>Conditional rendering refers to the dynamic output of user interface markups based on a
                            condition state. It works in the same way as JavaScript conditions. Using conditional
                            rendering, it is possible to toggle specific application functions, API data rendering, hide
                            or show elements, decide permission levels, authentication handling, and so on.</p>
                        <p>There are different approaches for implementing conditional rendering in React. Some of them
                            are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using if-else conditional logic which is suitable for smaller as well as for
                                medium-sized applications</li>
                            <li>Using ternary operators, which takes away some amount of complication from if-else
                                statements</li>
                            <li>Using element variables, which will enable us to write cleaner code.</li>

                    <h3>37. Explain how to create a simple React Hooks example program.</h3>
                    <article class="ibpage-article">
                        <p>I will assume that you are having some coding knowledge about JavaScript and have installed
                            Node on your system for creating a below given React Hook program. An installation of Node
                            comes along with the command-line tools: npm and npx, where npm is useful to install the
                            packages into a project and npx is useful in running commands of Node from the command line.
                            The npx looks in the current project folder for checking whether a command has been
                            installed there. When the command is not available on your computer, the npx will look in
                            the npmjs.com repository, then the latest version of the command script will be loaded and
                            will run without locally installing it. This feature is useful in creating a skeleton React
                            application within a few key presses.</p>
                        <p>Open the Terminal inside the folder of your choice, and run the following command:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">npx create-react-app react-items-with-hooks</code></pre>
                        <p>Here, the <code>create-react-app</code> is an app initializer created by Facebook, to help
                            with the easy and quick creation of React application, providing options to customize it
                            while creating the application? The above command will create a new folder named
                            react-items-with-hooks and it will be initialized with a basic React application. Now, you
                            will be able to open the project in your favourite IDE. You can see an src folder inside the
                            project along with the main application component <code>App.js</code>. This file is having a
                            single function <code>App()</code> which will return an element and it will make use of an
                            extended JavaScript syntax(JSX) for defining the component.</p>
                        <p>JSX will permit you for writing HTML-style template syntax directly into the JavaScript file.
                            This mixture of JavaScript and HTML will be converted by React toolchain into pure
                            JavaScript that will render the HTML element.</p>
                        <p>It is possible to define your own React components by writing a function that will return a
                            JSX element. You can try this by creating a new file <code>src/SearchItem.js</code>and put
                            the following code into it.</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">import React from 'react';
            export function SearchItem() {
             return (
               &lt;div&gt;
                 &lt;div className="search-input"&gt;
                   &lt;input type="text" placeholder="SearchItem"/&gt;
                 &lt;/div&gt;
                 &lt;h1 className="h1"&gt;Search Results&lt;/h1&gt;
                 &lt;div className="items"&gt;
                   &lt;table&gt;
                     &lt;thead&gt;
                       &lt;tr&gt;
                         &lt;th className="itemname-col"&gt;Item Name&lt;/th&gt;
                         &lt;th className="price-col"&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;
                         &lt;th className="quantity-col"&gt;Quantity&lt;/th&gt;
                       &lt;/tr&gt;
                     &lt;/thead&gt;
                     &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
                   &lt;/table&gt;
                 &lt;/div&gt;
               &lt;/div&gt;
             );
            }</code></pre>
                        <p>This is all about how you can create a component. It will only display the empty table and
                            doesn’t do anything. But you will be able to use the Search component in the application.
                            Open the file <code>src/App.js</code> and add the import statement given below to the top of
                            the file.</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">import { SearchItem } from './SearchItem';</code></pre>
                        <p>Now, from the logo.svg, import will be removed and then contents of returned value in the
                            function <code>App()</code> will be replaced with the following code:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">&lt;div className="App"&gt;
             &lt;header&gt;
               Items with Hooks
             &lt;/header&gt;
             &lt;SearchItem/&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p>You can notice that the element &lt;SearchItem/&gt; has been used just similar to an HTML
                            element. The JSX syntax will enable for including the components in this approach directly
                            within the JavaScript code. Your application can be tested by running the below-given
                            command in your terminal.</p>
                        <p><code>npm start</code></p>
                        <p>This command will compile your application and open your default browser into <a
                                href="http://localhost:4000" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">http://localhost:4000</a>. This command can be kept
                            on running when code development is in progress to make sure that the application is
                            up-to-date, and also this browser page will be reloaded each time you modify and save the
                            code.</p>
                        <p>This application will work finely, but it doesn’t look nice as it doesn’t react to any input
                            from the user. You can make it more interactive by adding a state with React Hooks, adding
                            authentication, etc.</p>

                        <p>Passing data between sibling components of React is possible using React Router with the help
                            of <code>history.push</code> and <code>match.params</code>.</p>
                        <p>In the code given below, we have a Parent component<code> AppDemo.js</code> and have two
                            Child Components <code>HomePage</code> and <code>AboutPage</code>. Everything is kept inside
                            a Router by using React-router Route. It is also having a route for
                            <code>/about/{params}</code> where we will pass the data.</p>
